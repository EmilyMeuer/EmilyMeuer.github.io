		<p>Knitting is a method by which yarn is manipulated to create 
		a textile or fabric for use in many types of garments.</p>

		<h4>How to Knit</h4>
		<p>Knitting creates multiple loops of yarn, called stitches, 
		in a line or tube. Knitting has multiple active stitches on the 
		needle at one time. Knitted fabric consists of a number of consecutive 
		rows of intermeshing of loops. As each row progresses, a newly created 
		loop is pulled through one or more loops from the prior row, placed on 
		the gaining needle, and the loops from the prior row are then pulled 
		off the other needle.</p>

		<p>Knitting may be done by hand or by using a machine.</p>

			<h4>Customizing Knitting Projects</h4>
			<p>Different types of yarns (fibre type, texture, and twist), needle sizes, 
			and stitch types may be used to achieve knitted fabrics with different properties 
			(color, texture, weight, heat retention, look, water resistance, and/or integrity).</p>
